‚ÄúEducation is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.‚Äù  ‚Äï   Socrates

I am an aspiring software developer who has taught himself JavaScript and React, using those languages to build multiple applications from scratch. Currently, I work with The Woodlands Financial Group to test their front-end software, while also building documentation in the form of a wiki with 300+ entries. I am actively working towards expanding my skillset to be full-stack capable, and going even further still with fields such as machine learning and robotics. 

I previously had completed college with a business degree, hoping to have the opportunity to work with ground-breaking departments to help market cutting-edge projects. However, the reality came to me that I wanted to be the one creating that project. This came from a deep love of the sciences I've had since childhood, which is why I decided to make the difficult, long, and arduous but incredibly rewarding journey to learn software development. To this day, I have devoted my heart and mind to studying programming, never taking a single day off. For me, this is a lifetime commitment to learning and exploring the things that bring me the greatest joy. This passion is something I can bring to any company I may find myself working with.
